    <h1>BIOGRAPHY</h1>

    
    
    <div class = "card">
        <div class = "card-body text-bg-primary">In the acutal site, this page would be a way to get to know a curated version of the person who is, presumably, running
            the portfolio.  
        </div>
        <div class = "card-body text-bg-info">Needless to say, <b><u>no</u></b>.</div>
        <div class = "card-body text-bg-light">Internet privacy is important.</div>
        <div class = "card-body text-bg-warning">It wasn't all that long ago that the general advice was to share nothing identifiable.</div>
        <div class = "card-body text-bg-danger">However, the card will give a single hint to a single aspect of my identity.</div>

        <strong>Remember!</strong> Never trust information you see only from a single, unverified source- there are 
        many people who seek only to decieve and confuse.

    <div class = "alert alert-info alert-dismissible">
        <button type = "button" class = "btn-close" data-bs-dismiss="alert"></button>
        There is no social media attached to this bio because the author of this project has no social media.
